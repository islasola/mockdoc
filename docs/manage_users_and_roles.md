In an organization, Zilliz Cloud provides the following types of user roles:

- **Organization owner**: can manage organization settings and users in the organization. For example, you can create an organization, invite or remove a user to or from the organization, edit the roles of users in the organization, and modify organization settings.
- **Organization member**: can access or leave the organization to which you belong and has read-only permissions on organization settings.

This tutorial guides you through how to manage users and roles.

For information on how to manage organizations, refer to [Manage Organizations]().
