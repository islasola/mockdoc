Zilliz Cloud allows users to create and manage organizations, and each organization can contain one or more projects. By grouping projects under a single organization, it's easy to manage users and permissions across multiple projects. Each project in an organization uses the same billing method, so you don't need to worry about keeping track of multiple billing configurations.

Organizations also allow one or more users to control billing and user permissions for all projects within the organization. This makes it easy to enable access control and ensure that users have the right permissions to perform their tasks.

In an organization, Zilliz Cloud provides the following types of user roles:

- **Organization owner**: can manage organization settings and users in the organization. For example, you can create an organization, invite or remove a user to or from the organization, edit the roles of users in the organization, and modify organization settings.
- **Organization member**: can access or leave the organization to which you belong and has read-only permissions on organization settings.

This tutorial guides you through how to manage organizations.

For information on how to manage users and roles in an organization, refer to [Manage Users and Roles]().
